# Working with Remote Machines

This Github directory contains:

 - `.tmux.conf`: a friendly starter Tmux configuration.

## Tmux Configuration

This configuration unbinds Tmux's C-b keystroke, replacing it with C-a. C-a is
what GNU Screen uses, which is why this is a common change. I've decided to use
C-a here because this is what I, most other Tmux users, and many online
tutorials use, and would be easiest for readers to become acquainted with. The configuration file also adjusts colors and creates a helpful status bar.
