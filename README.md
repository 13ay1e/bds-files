# The Supplementary Material Repository for Bioinformatics Data Skills

![The cover of "Bioinformatics Data Skills"](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920030157/rc_lrg.jpg)

**Caveat emptor: this book is still being actively written, so all materials in
this repository may chnage**.

This repository contains the supplementary files for my book, "Bioinformatics
Data Skills", published by O'Reilly Media. This Github repository will also
contain errata for the book, as well as be a resource for additional
information that didn't fit in the book. Although I've made an strong, strong
effort to focus on the subset of bioinformatics tools that will not go out of
date is this rapidly changing field, if certain tools do become obsolete I will
use this repository to host alternatives.

You can purchase an early release of the book [directly from
O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030157.do). If you're still
hesitant, you can read a reviews of the book's early release on O'Reilly's site
or read [Dave Tang's
review](http://davetang.org/muse/2014/04/03/bioinformatics-data-skills/).
