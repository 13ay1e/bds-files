## Markdown Editors

If you prefer to edit Markdown files directly in an WYSIWYG editor, here are
some good editors you might want to try:

 - [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) (OS X)
 - [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) (Windows)

Classic editors like Vim and Emacs also have syntax highlighting for Markdown.
