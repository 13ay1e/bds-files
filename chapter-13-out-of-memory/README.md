## BGZF

Section 4 of the [Sam Format
Specification](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf) has details about
the BGZF format.

Peter Cock also has a [terrific
post](http://blastedbio.blogspot.com/2011/11/bgzf-blocked-bigger-better-gzip.html)
about this format on his blog [Blasted
Bioinformatics](http://blastedbio.blogspot.com/).
