# Remedial Unix Shell

## Useful Unix shortcuts

These are *essential* if you spend a lot of time in the shell. See the [preface
readme](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files/blob/master/chapter-00-preface/README.md)
for more details on how I set up my terminal (some of these changes are
necessary for the following to work):

 - `control-a`: move cursor to beginning of terminal line.
 - `control-e`: move cursor to end of terminal line.
 - `control-k`: delete (or *k*ill) all text from cursor to end of line.
 - `option-delete`: delete an entire word
 - `option-b`: move cursor backwards an entire word.
 - `option-f`: move cursor forwards an entire word.

## The Unix Chainsaw

I use this quote from Gary Bernhardt's excellent talk [The UNIX
Chainsaw](http://confreaks.tv/videos/cascadiaruby2011-the-unix-chainsaw). It's
entertaining and includes some very nice examples of how powerful Unix (in the
context of software development, but still generally applicable).

## Doug McIlroy's "Garden Hose" Pipe Quote

The "garden hose" quote is from an October 1964 [Bell Labs
memo](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/mdmpipe.html). There's a cool image of
the memo here: http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/pipes/
