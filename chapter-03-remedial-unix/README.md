# Remedial Unix Shell

## The Unix Chainsaw

I use this quote from Gary Bernhardt's excellent talk [The UNIX
Chainsaw](http://confreaks.tv/videos/cascadiaruby2011-the-unix-chainsaw). It's
entertaining and includes some very nice examples of how powerful Unix (in the
context of software development, but still generally applicable).

## Doug McIlroy's "Garden Hose" Pipe Quote

The "garden hose" quote is from an October 1964 [Bell Labs
memo](http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/mdmpipe.html). There's a cool image of
the memo here: http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/pipes/
